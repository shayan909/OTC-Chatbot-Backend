Disease Classes:
-Whenever a new label is added in Disease Dataset, make sure that one of the two actions are done:
	1)Write Group diseases together to make their separate model. Order should be kept w.r.t prediction as diseases in later groups or after '-' in a single group might get chalked off.
	2)Write disease(s) separately when disease have entirely distinct symptoms.
